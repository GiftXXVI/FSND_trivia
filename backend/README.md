# Trivia API Documentation

## Introduction

The Trivia API forms the backend of the Trivia App. It connects client applications to the database and allows the client applications to communicate with the database using a set of simple, standards compliant HTTP methods.

## Getting Started

- Base URL: the API can be accessed at the following URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

- Authentication: the API does not yet support any authentication methods or API keys.

## Errors

Errors are returned in the following format:

the returned json object has an `error` value reflecting the HTTP status code of the error, a `message` reflecting the HTTP status code message and a `success` value of `false` indicating that the operation was not successful.

```javascript
{
  "error": 405,
  "message": "Method Not Allowed",
  "success": false
}
```

In the event of an error, the API may return one of the following HTTP status codes and messages:

- 404: Not Found
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
- 400: Bad Request
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 500: Internal Server Error
